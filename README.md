# The Odin Project - Recursion

This is the solution of the [Recursion](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion) project, from the [Javascript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript) of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Project Description

The project consists of two assignments:

- The first is to write a recursive function that takes "n" and will return an array with the "n" fibonacci numbers.

- The second is to write a recursive function that takes an unsorted array and returns the array sorted using the merge sort algorithm,
this algorithm consists of dividing the array in half until the arrays are of length 1, then merge the arrays in order, so we use recursion to divide the array and then merge the arrays.
